# AsteroidFun
Just a fun little project to make a basic spaceship vs. asteroid 2D game.  Using following:
* PhysicsJS (gravity, collision, restitution)
 * Pretty cool stuff: http://wellcaffeinated.net/PhysicsJS/
* CSS

## HowTo
Use up/left/right arrow keys.  Shoot with 'z'.  Watch out for asteroids.  Some of then disappear if you hit them twice.  (Not sure why others don't, it's a bug.)
